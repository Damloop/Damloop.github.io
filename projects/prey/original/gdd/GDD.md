# 1. GAME OBJECTIVES
Humanity is in danger. The undead rise from their graves with bloodlust, and no one remains alive—you are alone.  
Fight alongside the **Soldier Without a Name (SWN)** to uncover the terrifying truth while battling hordes of zombies and solving puzzles across the dark lands of Middle Earth.

---

# 2. STORY OVERVIEW
You are the **Soldier Without a Name**, a warrior fighting in the **Red Army (RA)** against the **Golems** in the **Ice Mountains**, north of your hometown **Midgar**.

These battles take place after the **Great War**, where humans united against **The Void** and **The Dark Ones**. With the help of the **Ancients**, The Void was sealed inside the **Dungeon of Pain**.

Before being defeated, The Void cast a poisonous spell across Middle Earth, forcing all humans to wear masks to breathe. Feeling betrayed, the Ancients removed all weapons from the world.

During a Red Army advance, a massive explosion blinds and knocks out everyone. When the SWN awakens, he is the only survivor. The sky and land have turned dark.

Returning to Midgar, he discovers the city has become a desolate, zombie-infested ruin.

As the story progresses, the SWN learns:

- The Golems sought help from the Dark Ones.  
- The Dark Ones consumed the Golems and began corrupting the world.  
- The Void has returned.  
- The SWN survived because the **Ancients protected him with Ancient Magic**.  
- The SWN is the son of an Ancient and a human woman absorbed by The Void during the Great War.  

The SWN is the key to stopping the extinction of humanity.
